## 🧬 About Me

I study life not merely as a phenomenon, but as an intelligible form—ordered, dynamic, and luminous.  
I'm currently a **Biology student at UNAM**, working at the intersection of:

- 🧠 **Neuroscience**  
- ⚛️ **Biophysics and electrophysiology**  
- 🧫 **Histology and histopathology**  
- 📊 **Mathematical modeling of dynamical systems**

I'm particularly fascinated by the **biophysical substrates of consciousness**, the **computational geometry of mental pathology**, and the **epistemic structure of the nervous system**.  

My intellectual formation draws upon **Aristotelian-Thomistic metaphysics**, **Augustinian introspection**, and the scientific legacy of **Ramón y Cajal**, **John Eccles**, **Eric Kandel**, and many scientist and philosophers.  
I believe that beauty, structure, and intelligibility are not accidental features of reality—but expressions of **Logos**.

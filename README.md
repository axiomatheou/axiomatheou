## 🧬 About Me  

I study biology at the intersection of physics, mathematics, and philosophy. My intended work focuses on understanding living systems through their underlying dynamics: how structure emerges from thermodynamic constraints, how networks give rise to behavior, and how different levels of description relate to each other.

Main areas of interest:

- 🧠 **Neuroscience, Cognitive Science & Neuropathology** – excitable systems, neural networks, theoretical approaches to brain function and mind, mental illness, trauma, psychological structures, psychiatry and neurology
- ⚛️ **Biophysics & Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics** – dissipative structures, electrophisiology, electricity, thermodynamical principles in living systems
- 🔬 **Histology & Histopathology** – tissue architecture, experimental techniques, structural patterns in disease
- 📊 **Complex Systems & Mathematical Modeling** – dynamical systems, systems biology, biological networks, mathematical physiology
- 🎲 **Statistics** – heavy-tailed distributions, antifragility, modeling uncertainty
- 🧩 **Philosophy** – metaphysics, philosophy of mind, philosophy and history of science

I write occasional essays on [Medium](https://medium.com/@axiomatheou) exploring these topics.

## 🧬 About Me  

I study **life as intelligibility**: not only as a phenomenon, but as a **structured and dynamic form**.  
My academic path bridges biology, physics, and philosophy, seeking to understand how matter gives rise to order, complexity, and mind.  

I work at the intersection of:  

- 🧠 **Neuroscience** – from networks to the biophysics of consciousness  
- ⚛️ **Biophysics & Electrophysiology** – ion channels, pulses, and cellular excitability  
- 🧫 **Histology & Histopathology** – structure, disease, and their hidden patterns  
- 📊 **Mathematical & Physical Models** – dynamical systems, entropy, and emergent order  

My main interests include **non-equilibrium thermodynamics, dissipative structures, complexity, emergence, and the philosophy of science**.

## 🧰 Tools & Languages  

- **Programming:** `Python`, `R`, `Bash`, learning `C++`  
- **Methods:** data analysis, dynamical systems simulation, mathematical modeling, histology, molecular biology, chemistry 
- **Other skills:** LaTeX, computational neuroscience, agent-based modeling (NetLogo), writing, public speeches, electronics

## 🐾 Beyond Science  

- 📜 **Metaphysics & Philosophy of Mind** – questions of being, knowledge, and thought  
- 🏛️ **History & Classics** – Greece, Rome, and the languages of the World (*Latin, Ancient Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Deutsch*)  
- 🐈 **Cats** — Catullus, Clío, and Calímaco, my quiet companions in study and life
